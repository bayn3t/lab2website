  <h1>The Legacy of Oasis</h1>

  <p>
    Oasis's legacy is defined by their role as leaders of 
    the Britpop movement in the 1990s, characterized by their 
    anthemic rock music, massive stadium shows like the Knebworth 
    concerts, and the intense but commercially successful rivalry 
    between brothers Noel and Liam Gallagher. Despite internal conflicts 
    leading to their 2009 breakup, their music sold over 75 million records 
    and influenced many subsequent bands. They are celebrated for iconic 
    albums like Definitely Maybe and (What's the Story) Morning Glory? and 
    their lasting impact on British culture.
